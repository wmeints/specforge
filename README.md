# Reforge

Welcome to Reforge, a tool to help you get started with spec-driven development
using AI. This repository contains the sources for the Reforge tool. You can use
this tool to quickly set up your project for spec-driven development using
an AI coding agent.

------

**NOTICE:** This project is in early development stages, it is not complete
and should only be used if you love experimenting with spec-driven development.

------

## Getting started

Download the latest release of the Reforge CLI, and make sure it is in your
`PATH` environment variable.

Then, run the following command to initialize your project:

```shell
reforge init
```

The tool will ask for the agent you're using (Claude Code or Github Copilot)
and deploy the templates needed to start building software through
specifications with your coding agent.

Read through the next section to learn how to use the templates.

## How does it work?

The spec-driven development approach works like this:

- First, start with a `/spec <feature-description>` prompt in your coding
  agent. This prompt helps you specify on a feature level what you want to add
  to your software project. This builds a layer of context information
  containing functional requirements, architectural guidelines, and data
  structures.

- Next, we take the initial specification generated by the `/spec` prompt
  and extend it with a `/stories <path-to-spec-directory>` prompt. In this
  prompt we translate the specification into a set of user stories that can
  be implemented one-by-one.

  The stories are written into the `docs/specifications/<spec-title>/stories/`
  directory so you can review them and improve them. When you're happy, you
  can move on to the next step.

- To make implementation as straightforward as possible , we'll use the 
  `/tasks <path-to-story-directory>` prompt to split a story into a set of
  high-level tasks that can be manually executed or executed by the agent to 
  write code, run tests, document steps, etc.

- Finally, you can complete tasks manually or let the coding
  agent complete the work.

## Supported agents

Currently, we support setting Claude Code. We're working on Github Copilot next!
After that, we'll evaluate the results and add agent support as needed.

## Frequently asked questions

- **Can features be documented on a backlog?**  
  We tested prompts that would use Github Issues to record features and
  implementation plans, but the results are mediocre at best. The problem
  lies in the fact that agents aren't typically connected to a backlog
  management tool. We found that agents work better if they can browse
  specs and plans as markdown files in the source repository.

- **What operating systems are supported?**  
  We support Windows, Mac, and Linux. The prompt templates themselves are
  saved as markdown files in your project, and Reforge isn't involved in
  using them.

- **Can I customize the prompt templates?**  
  You certainly can, we recommend you review the deployed prompt templates
  and modify them to suit your project. We've made some assumptions to help
  flatten the learning curve.

- **Are you using the tool yourself?**  
  We use the tool on this project to build the tool itself. While challenging
  at first, we've managed to improve the behavior quite quickly, proving that
  this approach works quite well.
