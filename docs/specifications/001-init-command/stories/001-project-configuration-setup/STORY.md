## Story description

As a developer, I want the system to create and manage project configuration data so that the init command can track which agent was selected and what version of templates was deployed.

## Acceptance criteria

- System creates a `.reforge.json` file during initialization
- Configuration file contains the selected agent type (copilot or claude)
- Configuration file contains the deployed package version
- Configuration file contains project metadata
- Configuration file is valid JSON and can be parsed

## Technical context

### Impact on the application architecture (optional)

- Introduces configuration file management capabilities
- Establishes project metadata structure
- Defines serialization/deserialization for project config

### Impact on the application functionality (optional)

- Enables tracking of project state
- Provides foundation for future commands that need to know project configuration

### Impact on deployment of the application (optional)

No direct deployment impact

## Implementation tasks (required)

- Define `.reforge.json` schema structure
- Implement configuration file creation functionality
- Implement configuration file parsing/validation
- Add version tracking for template deployment
- Handle JSON serialization errors gracefully

## Testing tasks (required)

- Unit test configuration file creation
- Unit test JSON parsing and validation
- Test invalid JSON handling
- Test file system permission errors
- Integration test configuration file contents

## Deployment tasks (required)

No specific deployment tasks required

## Dependencies (required)

None - this is the foundational story

## Assumptions (required)

- JSON format is acceptable for configuration storage
- Configuration file should be human-readable
- Package version can be determined at runtime
- File system permissions allow writing to target directory
