# Task: Implement JSON File Operations

## Description
Create utility functions in the library for reading, writing, and validating JSON configuration files with proper error handling.

## Required Files
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/STORY.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/PLAN.md`

## Implementation Details
- Implement directory creation and validation functions
- Add JSON file writing with proper error handling and human-readable formatting
- Create configuration file reading and parsing functions
- Add permission checking before file operations
- Implement graceful error handling for IO and JSON parsing errors
- Support for creating `.reforge.json` in target directories

## Acceptance Criteria
- Functions can create directories when they don't exist
- JSON files are written with proper formatting and indentation
- File reading handles missing files, permission errors, and invalid JSON gracefully
- Permission checks prevent operation failures
- All file operations use the custom error types
- Functions work across different operating systems
