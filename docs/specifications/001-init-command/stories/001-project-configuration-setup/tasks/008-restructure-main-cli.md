# Task: Restructure Main CLI

## Description
Replace the placeholder `src/main.rs` with a proper clap-based CLI framework that supports subcommands and proper error handling.

## Required Files
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/STORY.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/PLAN.md`

## Implementation Details
- Replace placeholder main.rs with clap-based CLI structure
- Define main CLI struct with derive macros
- Add proper subcommand support (starting with init)
- Implement proper error handling and exit codes
- Add version information and help documentation
- Structure the CLI to be extensible for future commands

## Acceptance Criteria
- Main CLI uses clap derive macros for argument parsing
- Subcommand structure is properly implemented
- Error handling provides meaningful messages to users
- Help documentation is clear and informative
- CLI follows standard Unix conventions for exit codes
- Code is structured to easily add new subcommands
