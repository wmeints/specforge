# Task: Implement File Overwrite Confirmation

## Description
Add confirmation prompt functionality to handle existing `.reforge.json` files and prevent accidental overwrites.

## Required Files
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/STORY.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/PLAN.md`

## Implementation Details
- Check for existing `.reforge.json` file in target directory
- Display confirmation prompt when existing file is found
- Show file modification date and basic info in the prompt
- Allow user to confirm overwrite or cancel operation
- Handle user cancellation gracefully without error
- Skip confirmation if `--force` flag is provided (future enhancement)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Existing files are detected before attempting write operations
- Confirmation prompt is clear and informative
- User can choose to overwrite or cancel
- Cancellation exits gracefully without error messages
- File information helps user make informed decisions
- Logic is ready for future --force flag implementation

## Phase
