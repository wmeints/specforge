# Task: Test Error Scenarios and Edge Cases

## Description
Create comprehensive tests for error scenarios and edge cases to ensure robust error handling throughout the system.

## Required Files
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/STORY.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/PLAN.md`

## Implementation Details
- Test invalid agent specification scenarios
- Test permission denied on target directory
- Test user declining overwrite confirmation
- Test invalid JSON in existing configuration files
- Test read-only file system scenarios
- Test non-existent parent directories
- Test disk space exhaustion scenarios
- Test network-related errors for future URL handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- All identified error scenarios have corresponding tests
- Error messages are validated for clarity and helpfulness
- Exit codes are tested for different error types
- Recovery scenarios are tested where applicable
- Edge cases like empty inputs and very long paths are covered
- Tests verify that no sensitive information is leaked in errors
- Error handling doesn't cause crashes or undefined behavior
