# Task: Add Packages Array Creation

## Description
Implement creation of the packages array with template package information during configuration file generation.

## Required Files
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/STORY.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/PLAN.md`

## Implementation Details
- Create initial packages array with template package information
- Include package ID, optional URL, and version information
- Generate appropriate package entries based on selected agent
- Handle template package versioning (use current crate version or default)
- Structure packages array to support future template deployment tracking
- Ensure packages array follows the JSON schema specification

## Acceptance Criteria
- Packages array is created with appropriate template package entries
- Package IDs are meaningful and consistent
- Version information is accurate and follows semantic versioning
- Package structure supports future template deployment features
- JSON schema matches the specification from research
- Different agents can have different default packages if needed
