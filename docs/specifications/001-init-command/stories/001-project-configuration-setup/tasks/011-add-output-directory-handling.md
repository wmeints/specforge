# Task: Add Output Directory Handling

## Description
Implement output directory handling with creation capabilities and validation for the init command.

## Required Files
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/STORY.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/PLAN.md`

## Implementation Details
- Handle custom output directory from `--output-directory` flag
- Default to current working directory when no flag provided
- Create target directory if it doesn't exist
- Validate directory permissions before proceeding
- Resolve and canonicalize directory paths
- Provide clear error messages for permission or path issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- Custom output directories are properly validated and created
- Current directory is used as default when no flag provided
- Directory creation works for nested paths
- Permission checks prevent operation failures
- Path resolution handles relative and absolute paths correctly
- Error messages clearly describe directory-related issues

## Phase
