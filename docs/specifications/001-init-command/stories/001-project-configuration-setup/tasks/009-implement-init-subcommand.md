# Task: Implement Init Subcommand

## Description
Create the init subcommand structure in `src/cli/init.rs` with support for agent selection and output directory configuration.

## Required Files
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/STORY.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/PLAN.md`

## Implementation Details
- Implement init subcommand with clap derive macros
- Support `--agent` flag for direct agent specification (copilot or claude)
- Support `--output-directory` flag for custom target directory
- Add basic command structure and argument validation
- Prepare structure for interactive prompts and file operations
- Include proper help documentation for the subcommand

## Acceptance Criteria
- Init subcommand is properly defined with clap
- Agent flag accepts valid agent types and rejects invalid ones
- Output directory flag accepts paths and validates them
- Subcommand integrates with main CLI structure
- Help documentation is clear for all flags and options
- Command structure is ready for implementation logic
