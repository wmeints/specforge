# Task: Write Unit Tests for File Operations

## Description
Create unit tests for file operation utilities including directory creation, JSON file writing/reading, and permission handling.

## Required Files
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/STORY.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/specifications/001-init-command/stories/001-project-configuration-setup/PLAN.md`

## Implementation Details
- Test directory creation and validation functions
- Test JSON file writing and reading operations
- Test permission error handling scenarios
- Test invalid JSON file recovery
- Use temporary directories for isolated testing
- Test cross-platform file operations
- Include tests for concurrent access scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- Directory creation works for both existing and new directories
- JSON file I/O handles formatting and parsing correctly
- Permission errors are detected and handled appropriately
- Invalid JSON files are handled without crashes
- Tests use proper cleanup to avoid test interference
- File operations work consistently across platforms
- Error scenarios produce meaningful error messages

## Phase
Phase 5: Testing
