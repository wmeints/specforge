## Story description

As a developer, I want the system to handle error conditions gracefully with clear, helpful error messages so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it when initialization fails.

## Acceptance criteria

- Invalid agent specified: displays error message listing valid agents (copilot, claude)
- Permission denied: displays clear error when lacking write permissions to target directory
- Network/template access issues: displays helpful error message if templates cannot be accessed
- All error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- System exits with appropriate error codes for different failure types
- No partial initialization occurs when errors are encountered

## Technical context

### Impact on the application architecture (optional)

- Establishes error handling patterns for CLI commands
- Implements consistent error messaging across the application
- Adds error classification and reporting capabilities

### Impact on the application functionality (optional)

- Improves user experience during failure scenarios
- Provides debugging information for troubleshooting
- Prevents corrupted or partial project initialization

### Impact on deployment of the application (optional)

No direct deployment impact

## Implementation tasks (required)

- Implement agent validation with specific error messages
- Add file system permission checking and error handling
- Implement template access verification and error reporting
- Create consistent error message formatting
- Add appropriate exit codes for different error types
- Implement cleanup for failed initialization attempts

## Testing tasks (required)

- Test invalid agent error message and exit code
- Test permission denied error (simulate read-only directory)
- Test template access failure (simulate network/file issues)
- Test error message clarity and actionability
- Test that no partial files are created during failures
- Test exit code consistency across error types

## Deployment tasks (required)

No specific deployment tasks required

## Dependencies (required)

- Story 001: Project Configuration Setup
- Story 002: Basic Init Command
- Story 003: Init with Agent Flag

## Assumptions (required)

- Users prefer specific error messages over generic failures
- Exit codes should follow standard conventions
- Template access failures are possible and should be handled
- File system permissions can be checked before attempting operations
- Cleanup of partial state is important for user experience

[QUESTION: What specific exit codes should be used for different error types? Should the system attempt to provide suggestions for fixing permission issues?]
