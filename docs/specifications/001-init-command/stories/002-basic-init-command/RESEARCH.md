Status: Complete

## Technical Context Research

### Current CLI Framework and Structure

**Key Findings:**
- Uses **Clap 4.x** with derive macros for CLI parsing
- **Dialoguer 0.10** already integrated for interactive prompts with ColorfulTheme
- Project structure is well-organized with separate modules for CLI, config, error handling, and file operations
- Current executable name is "specforge" (recently renamed from "reforge")

**Existing Architecture:**
- `main.rs`: Entry point with command dispatching and error handling
- `cli/init.rs`: InitCommand struct with comprehensive validation and interactive features
- `config/project.rs`: ProjectConfig, Agent enum, and Package struct with full validation
- `file_ops.rs`: Complete file operations with backup, confirmation, and error handling
- `error.rs`: Rich error types with context and exit codes

**Interactive Prompt Capabilities:**
- Already supports agent selection via dialoguer::Select
- Confirmation prompts for file overwriting implemented
- User cancellation handling (Ctrl+C, Esc) properly implemented
- Colorful theme and user-friendly prompts already in place

### Template Deployment System Research

**Current State:**
- No actual template files exist yet (templates/ directory not found)
- Package-based system designed with Package struct supporting:
  - Package ID and version tracking
  - Optional URL for future remote template fetching
  - Validation for semantic versioning
  - Support for multiple packages per agent

**Template Package Design:**
- "specforge-copilot-templates" package ID for GitHub Copilot
- "specforge-claude-templates" package ID for Claude
- Version tracking using cargo package version
- Ready for future template deployment features

### Configuration File Creation Research

**Robust Implementation Already Exists:**
- `.specforge.json` file creation with pretty-printed JSON formatting
- Comprehensive validation before writing
- Backup system with automatic cleanup on success
- Permission checks and directory creation
- File overwrite confirmation with detailed file information display
- Metadata system with required fields (created_at) and extensible custom fields

### Progress Feedback and User Experience

**Current Capabilities:**
- Emoji-based progress indicators (ℹ️, ✅, ❌, ⚠️)
- Detailed error messages with context
- User-friendly confirmation prompts
- Graceful cancellation handling
- Summary of actions taken

**Best Practice Alignment:**
- Follows 2024 Rust CLI best practices
- Uses indicatif-compatible patterns (though not explicitly implemented)
- Provides clear feedback at each step
- Handles errors gracefully with suggestions

## Implementation Task Research

### Task: Implement `init` subcommand in CLI framework
**Finding:** Already implemented and comprehensive
- InitCommand struct with all required fields
- Command registration in main.rs
- Validation and execution methods complete

### Task: Create interactive agent selection prompt
**Finding:** Already implemented with dialoguer
- Uses Select widget with descriptive options
- Handles user cancellation
- Provides clear feedback on selection

### Task: Implement template deployment logic for each agent type
**Finding:** Package system ready, but no actual template deployment
- Package creation logic implemented for both agents
- Missing: Actual template file deployment/copying
- Missing: Template source location and content

### Task: Add progress feedback during initialization
**Finding:** Good foundation exists
- Status messages with emojis
- Step-by-step progress indication
- Could benefit from more detailed progress for longer operations

### Task: Integrate configuration file creation
**Finding:** Fully implemented and robust
- Complete file operations with error handling
- Backup system and permission checks
- User confirmation for overwrites

### Task: Implement directory validation (empty check)
**Finding:** Advanced validation already implemented
- Empty directory checking via config file existence
- Path canonicalization and validation
- Permission checking before operations

## Testing Task Research

### Integration Tests Framework
**Current State:**
- Uses assert_cmd for CLI integration testing
- tempfile for test isolation
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components

**Test Infrastructure Needs:**
- Integration tests for full init flow (both agents)
- Mock template deployment for testing
- User input simulation for interactive prompts
- Timing tests for performance requirements

---

## Dependencies Research

### Story 001: Project Configuration Setup
**Status:** Already implemented
- ProjectConfig creation with metadata
- Agent-specific package configuration
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Validation system complete

### Third-party Libraries
**Already Integrated:**
- clap 4.5.47 with derive features
- serde 1.0 with derive features
- serde_json 1.0
- dialoguer 0.10
- chrono 0.4 with serde features

**Development Dependencies:**
- tempfile 3.0 for test isolation
- assert_cmd 2.0 for integration testing
- predicates 3.0 for test assertions

---

## Assumptions Validation

### "Users understand the difference between copilot and claude agents"
**Research Findings:**
- Current implementation provides descriptions for each agent
- Agent::description() method returns helpful explanatory text
- Interactive selection shows both agent name and description

### "Terminal supports interactive prompts"
**Research Findings:**
- Dialoguer handles various terminal capabilities gracefully
- User cancellation (Ctrl+C, Esc) properly handled
- Fallback mechanisms in place for non-interactive environments

### "Template files are accessible during runtime"
**Research Findings:**
- No actual template files exist yet
- Package system designed for future template deployment
- Would need embedded templates or external template source

### "Empty directory check is sufficient for safe initialization"
**Research Findings:**
- Current implementation checks for existing .specforge.json file
- File overwrite confirmation system provides additional safety
- Advanced path validation prevents common issues

## Implementation Gaps Identified

1. **Template Content**: No actual template files or deployment logic
2. **Template Source**: Need to determine where templates come from (embedded, remote, filesystem)
3. **Performance**: Current implementation should meet 5-second requirement, but no benchmarks
4. **Integration Tests**: Need comprehensive end-to-end testing of full init flow

## Questions Identified

1. **[QUESTION: Where do template files come from - embedded resources, filesystem, or remote URLs?]**
2. **[QUESTION: What specific template content should be deployed for each agent type?]**
3. **[QUESTION: Should the system create additional directory structure beyond just .specforge.json?]**
4. **[QUESTION: How should we handle template deployment failures - rollback or partial success?]**
