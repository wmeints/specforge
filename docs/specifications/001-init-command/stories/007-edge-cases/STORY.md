## Story description

As a developer, I want the system to handle unusual edge cases correctly so that initialization works reliably even in unexpected situations like existing git repositories, read-only files, or partially initialized projects.

## Acceptance criteria

- Target directory doesn't exist: system creates the directory structure without errors
- Partial existing project: system handles scenarios where some template files exist and others don't
- Read-only files in target directory: system handles permission conflicts appropriately
- Existing git repository: system initializes without interacting with or modifying git state
- Mixed file permissions in target directory are handled gracefully
- System maintains consistency even in complex file system scenarios

## Technical context

### Impact on the application architecture (optional)

- Adds robust file system handling capabilities
- Implements comprehensive permission checking
- Ensures compatibility with existing project structures

### Impact on the application functionality (optional)

- Increases reliability in diverse development environments  
- Supports initialization in complex directory structures
- Maintains separation of concerns with version control systems

### Impact on deployment of the application (optional)

No direct deployment impact

## Implementation tasks (required)

- Implement directory creation with proper error handling
- Add detection and handling of partial Reforge projects
- Implement read-only file conflict resolution
- Ensure git repository detection and non-interference
- Add comprehensive file permission checking
- Implement fallback strategies for complex scenarios

## Testing tasks (required)

- Test initialization when target directory doesn't exist
- Test partial project scenarios (some files exist, others don't)
- Test read-only file handling and user notification
- Test initialization in existing git repository (verify no git interaction)
- Test mixed permission scenarios
- Test deep nested directory creation
- Integration test complex real-world scenarios

## Deployment tasks (required)

No specific deployment tasks required

## Dependencies (required)

- Story 001: Project Configuration Setup
- Story 002: Basic Init Command
- Story 005: Existing Files Confirmation
- Story 006: Error Handling

## Assumptions (required)

- Git repositories are common in development environments
- File permission complexity varies by operating system
- Partial project states should be detected and handled
- Users expect consistent behavior regardless of edge cases
- Non-interference with existing version control is critical

[QUESTION: When encountering read-only files that need to be overwritten, should the system attempt to change permissions, skip those files, or abort initialization?]

[QUESTION: How should the system handle partial Reforge projects - should it update missing files, skip existing ones, or treat it as a conflict?]
