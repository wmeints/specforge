## Story description

As a developer, I want the system to ask for confirmation before overwriting existing files so that I don't accidentally lose important work when initializing in a directory that already contains files.

## Acceptance criteria

- System detects existing files that would be overwritten by templates
- System prompts user with clear confirmation message listing files to be overwritten
- User can confirm overwrite and initialization proceeds
- User can decline overwrite and system exits gracefully without changes
- System only overwrites files after explicit user confirmation
- Confirmation prompt clearly indicates consequences of the action

## Technical context

### Impact on the application architecture (optional)

- Adds file conflict detection capabilities
- Implements user confirmation interaction patterns
- Adds rollback/abort functionality for initialization process

### Impact on the application functionality (optional)

- Provides safety mechanisms for existing projects
- Enables recovery from accidental initialization attempts
- Supports mixed scenarios with partial existing files

### Impact on deployment of the application (optional)

No direct deployment impact

## Implementation tasks (required)

- Implement file conflict detection logic
- Create user confirmation prompt with file list
- Add confirmation input validation and parsing
- Implement graceful exit when user declines
- Ensure atomic operation (all or nothing file updates)
- Add clear messaging about overwrite consequences

## Testing tasks (required)

- Test detection of files that would be overwritten
- Test user confirmation with "yes" response
- Test user cancellation with "no" response  
- Test invalid confirmation input handling
- Test mixed scenario (some existing, some new files)
- Test that no changes occur when user declines
- Integration test full overwrite flow

## Deployment tasks (required)

No specific deployment tasks required

---

## Dependencies (required)

- Story 001: Project Configuration Setup
- Story 002: Basic Init Command (extends this functionality)

## Assumptions (required)

- Users prefer explicit confirmation over silent overwriting
- Terminal supports interactive confirmation prompts
- File detection can reliably identify conflicts
- Users understand consequences of overwriting files
- Atomic operations are preferred (all files or no files)

[QUESTION: Should the confirmation prompt show the full path of each file, or just the filename? Should it show a count if there are many files?]
